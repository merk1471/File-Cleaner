# File-Cleaner

After a while, your desktop can start to get ugly and your downloads folder gets filled with installers.

This python script organizes your Desktop and Download directories. To avoid issues, directories within the desktop and download directories are not modified, only standalone files that are of the types listed in extensions will be moved. Nothing will be deleted, however, duplicates and installers will be moved to other/suggested_delete folder.

Enjoy!
